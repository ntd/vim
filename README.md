A collection of plugins and customizations I'm using for [VIM](http://www.vim.org/). I'm keeping them online for my personal convenience.

The included scripts could be a modified version of the original ones, including (but not limited to):

* [VIM pathogen](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2332) to keep the scripts on their own bundle directory;
* [VIM projects](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=69) to arrange different source files in a tree way;
* [GTK+ vim syntax](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1000) for GTK+ and friends keywords recognition;
* [PHP correct indenting](http://www.2072productions.com/to/phpindent.txt) to improve the basic PHP syntax file;
* The [wombat](http://github.com/cschlueter/vim-wombat) color scheme.
